BML Traffic Model

This is an implementation of the Biham-Middleton-Levine (BML) traffic model in R. A description of the simulation and our project results can be found in the BML Simulation Report. All code used is available in BML_simulation.R, which should be read for implementation details. Sample output includes sample pictures that were produced by the code, as well as a GIF that cycles through the pictures.
